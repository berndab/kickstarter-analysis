# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
(Module 1.6.1 exercise)

This repository contains Kickstarter data and analysis to set the parameters for the launch a successful Kickstarter campaign for the theatrical play "Fever". The playwright's initial estimate of the cost to put on the play is $12,000.

First looking at Kickstarter campaigns in the US for all categories, the data shows that plays have the most Kickstarter campaigns and that these campaigns are among most successful.

Second, research of the plays favored by the playwright at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe:

* Be Prepared
* Checkpoint 22
* Cutting Off Kate Bush
* Jestia and Raedon
* The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Family

shows that all these plays had Kickstarter campaigns. If the "Feaver" is a play written in the same style as at least one of these plays then the data shows that the Kickstarter campaign for this play would attract enough donors to be successful. 

However, the data also shows that the campaign goal for “Fever” is outside the range of the successful Kickstarter campaigns for these Edinburgh Festival Fringe play and outside the range for sucessful Kickstarter plays campaigns in general.  The average Kickstarter goal for these Edinburgh plays is $2,100 with the highest being $4,000. In addition, mean goal of all successful US Kickstarter campaigns for plays is $5,049 while the mean goal for failed Kickstarter campaigns for plays is $10,554. This data indicates that the goal for this play's Kickstarter campaign must be significantly lower if the campaign is to succeed. The campaign goal should be below $10,000 and more closer to $3,000 - $4,000.

In addition, the data from all US Kickstarter campaigns show that the time of year that the campaign is launched significantly influences the campaign's chances of success. The data shows that campaigns launch in the May - June timeframe are the most successful.

The recommendations from this analysis is that for this Kickstarter campaign to have the greatest chance of success
* The play’s style should be similar to at least one of the plays favored by the playwright from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe
* The campaign’s goal is adjusted significantly downward to the $3,000 - $4,000 range
* The campaign is launch sometime in the May to June timeframe.
