# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
(Module 1.6.1 exercise)

This repository contains Kickstarter data and analysis that is used to determine the Kickstarter campaign parameters needed to have a successful campaign to fund the playwright's production of the play "Fever". The playwright's initial estimate of the cost to put on the play is $12,000.

First, looking at US Kickstarter campaigns for all categories, the data shows that plays have the most Kickstarter campaigns and that these campaigns are among most successful.

Second, research on the plays favored by the playwright at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe:

* Be Prepared
* Checkpoint 22
* Cutting Off Kate Bush
* Jestia and Raedon
* The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Family

shows that all of these plays had successful Kickstarter campaigns. If "Fever" is a play written in the same style of one of these plays, the data indicates that the Kickstarter campaign for "Fever" would attract enough donors to be successful. 

However, the data also shows that the campaign's goal for "Fever" of $12,000 is significantly greater than the mean campaign goal of $2,100 for these successful Edinburgh plays. In addition, the "Fever" campaign goal of $12,000 is well above the mean campaign goal of $5,049 for all successful US play Kickstarter campaigns and is also above the mean goal of $10,554 for all failed US play Kickstarter campaigns. This indicates that the playwright must set a significantly lower Kickstarter campaign goal of $3,000 - $4,000 in order for Fever’s Kickstarter campaign to have the highest chance of success.

In addition, the data from all US Kickstarter campaigns show that the time of year that the campaign is launch is significantly correlated to the highest number of successful Kickstarter campaigns. The data shows that the May to June timeframe consistently has the highest number of successful Kickstarter campaigns across all categories.

Based on this analysis of Kickstarter campaign data, the playwright should implement the following recommendations to have the greatest chance of success for the "Fever" Kickstarter campaign:
* The play’s style should be similar to one of the Edinburgh Festival plays favored by the playwright
* The play's Kickstarter campaign goal must be in the  $3,000 - $4,000 range to have the highest chance of success
* The play's Kickstarter campaign should be launched between the May to June timeframe to have the highest chance of success
